## Overview

This is a simple contact form that is responsive on all devices. It is built with React and styled with Tailwind Css. The form is validated using custom react validation and a custom validation message is displayed when the form is submitted.
It is follows the WCAG guidelines for accessibility. This involves using semantic HTML when possible and ARIA.

### The challenge

> Users should be able to :
- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if: 
  - A required field has been missed or is empty   
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form using only their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
